My name is **Yixin (Elaine) Wan** and I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [**Kai-Wei Chang**](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/) and have been a proud member of the [UCLANLP](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/members/) research group. My research focuses on building trustworthy multimodal generative models: specifically, I have worked on improving the controllability, fairness, and factuality in text and image generation. I completed my B.S. in Applied Mathematics (double major in Economics) also at UCLA. Go Bruins! 

Currently, I am a research intern at **Tencent AI Lab** in Bellevue, WA, working on controllable image editing. My mentor is [Lei Ke](https://www.kelei.site/) and [Wenhao Yu](https://wyu97.github.io/). Previously, I have interned at *Amazon AGI* and *Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)*.
